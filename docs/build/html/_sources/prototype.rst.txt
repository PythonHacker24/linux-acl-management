Prototype
=========

This is the prototype development section of the Linux ACL Management Project. After long discussions with Robert Tweedy and Mahmoud Zeydabadinezhad, development of prototype was decided. This codebase is where I experiment with designs and methods that were discussed, solve occuring problems, prove my design decisions, etc. while my mentors guide me and correct when I deviate from the requirements. This will ensure that I better understand all the requirements before starting with the final project. 

Note that since we haven't came up with coding practices, styles and rules, I am building it on my own judgement. Although, I am making sure to follow necessary practices since a lot of code from this repository is going to lay the base for components in the final project.
